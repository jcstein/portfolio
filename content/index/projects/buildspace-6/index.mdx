Around a month-and-a-half ago I started a project called [Wellness DAO](https://wellnessdao.xyz) with the goal of building a safe-space that revolves around community-driven wellness and breaking the stigma that exists around mental health care and well-being.

This project is the formation of a test DAO for Wellness DAO, with a token-gated membership page and its own governance token for submitting and voting on proposals.
